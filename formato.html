		<div class="post-content">
			<hr><p>The server has now performed a rollback to the 14th August 1.12 copy of the world, and updated to 1.19 once more.</p><p>You may read an explanation for the <a href="https://www.2b2t.org/rollback/">rollback here</a>, and what you may do if you are dissatisfied with this decision.</p><p>The server has now updated to 1.19 with the following changes removed:</p><p><strong>Chunk culling</strong></p><p><strong>Soft item economy reset</strong></p><p>The adjusted patch notes are below. You can read the old patch notes <a href="https://www.2b2t.org/2023-08-14/">here</a>.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Bad items</strong><br>
All items with illegitimate values for durability, enchants or stack sizes have been removed.</p>
<p><strong>Maps</strong><br>
Maps will now generate with a random and hidden ID. Players will see a random ID on the map item.</p>
<p><strong>Render distance</strong><br>
Render distance for each player has been greatly increased.</p>
<p><strong>World generation</strong><br>
The server now has a modified vanilla terrain generator to hide the seed and prevent players from generating their own copy of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Anticheat</strong><br>
The anticheat has been updated, and it is planned to keep the anticheat more strict and updated more frequently, particularly for preventing movement cheats.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The server has always had an anticheat, it has simply been updated along 1.19. The server has always tried to prevent cheating where possible.</p>
<p><strong>Animal spawning</strong><br>
Animals have not been correctly spawning in around the spawn area for over a decade, this was caused by the multiple biome changes throughout the game, resulting in animals not spawning at all where they really should.<br>
They should now correctly spawn where intended, and there are more of them around the spawn area.</p>
<p><strong>Monster spawning</strong><br>
Compared to 1.12, there are many more monsters closer to the vanilla amount limits.<br>
Additionally monster spawning has been changed to attempt to spawn more monsters closer to the player, avoiding spawning monsters too far where they may not activate.</p>
<p><strong>Phantoms</strong><br>
Phantoms and the phantom mechanic has been disabled entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Player obfuscation</strong><br>
It is no longer possible through cheats, to see another player's item enchantments or durability, or the player's health.</p>
<p><strong>End dimension</strong><br>
The end dimension dragon fight has been reset. Old gateways were broken due to bedrock breaking exploits, players may now fight the dragon to spawn new gateways.</p>
<p><strong>Health and hunger</strong><br>
The hunger system has been slowed down quite a bit. Regeneration will linger for longer below normal hunger filled.<br>
<strong>This is an experimental change and may be reverted</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lastly, we've managed to put all related servers back into the US East location, which should result in a much improved ping overall for most players.</strong></p>
